<p><h1>The First Discovery</h1></p>

<body>
  <p>The first fossilized dinosaur discovery was from the origins in <strong>1824</strong> by paleontologist <em>William Buckland</em>. The bones were first found in Oxfordshire, England, as Buckland named it as:</p>
  <p><acronym title="Great Lizard">Megalosaurus bucklandii</acronym> is dated as a late Middle Jurassic species, having been described in the 17th century.</p>
  
  <p> Meglosauridae is usually depicted as theropodic species, closely related to birds. <br/> Serrated teeth with three/four fingered clawed fingers help differientiate from the similar family <u>tyrannosauridaes</u>, whom have two clawed fingers.</p>
  <blockquote>Megalosauridae is a monophyletic family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs within the group Megalosauroidea. Appearing in the Middle Jurassic, megalosaurids were among the first major radiation of large theropod dinosaurs. <br /> They were a relatively primitive group of basal tetanurans containing two main subfamilies, Megalosaurinae and Afrovenatorinae, along with the basal genus Eustreptospondylus, an unresolved taxon which differs from both subfamilies.</blockquote>

      <p> The family 'Megalosauridae' is first coined because of the <del>first dinosaur discovery</del> Megalosaurus discovery , as other species joined in over the years under <acronym title= "Eustreptospondylinae, Megalosaurinae">subfamilies</acronym>, as listed below:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Eustreptospondylus</li>
		<li>Magnosaurus</li>
		<li>Streptospondylus</li>
		<li>Duriavenator</li>
		<li>Afrovenator</li>
